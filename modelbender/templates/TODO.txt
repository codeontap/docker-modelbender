TODO
====

This document attempts to outline the detectable deficiencies in the metamodel.

Poetically, it is very much a work in progress.

Miscelanious:
 * replace "ctx" with "enterprise" with name for enterprise-level context in templates.
 * move TODO items into top-level enterprise methods, so we can print them conveniently and conditionally here.
 * introduce intermediate "service" object, between domain and resource. Clear up ambiguity: almost everywhere we say "service" in the current codebase we should say "resource".

StateChart not populated
------------------------

The following resources do not have state charts config data.
{% for domain in ctx.get_domains() %}{% for resource in domain.get_resources() %}{% if not resource.state_chart.is_populated() %}
 * {{ domain }}.{{ resource }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}
